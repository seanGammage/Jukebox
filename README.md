# Jukebox

This is a WPF jukebox application created in Visual Studio using C#. The main purpose of the app is for a user at a bar to be 
able to play songs on the jukebox. Once the admin is logged in, he can add, update, or delete songs from the jukebox.
Once the user is logged in (or registers as a new user), he can add or delete songs to his playlist, and then play those songs.
This app was created using SCRUM methodology.
